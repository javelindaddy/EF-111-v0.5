The General Dynamicsâ€“Grumman EF-111A Raven is a retired electronic-warfare aircraft designed to replace the EB-66 Destroyer in the United States Air Force. Its crews and maintainers often called it the "Spark Vark", a play on the F-111's "Aardvark" nickname. The USAF contracted with Grumman in 1974 to convert some existing General Dynamics F-111As into electronic warfare aircraft. The USAF had considered the Navy / Marine Corps Grumman EA-6B Prowler, but desired a penetrating aircraft with supersonic speed. The EF-111 entered service in 1983 and served until its retirement in 1998.
